# coding_challenges

Welcome! One way I practice coding is to do coding challenges. A lot of times, I find myself lost in them and elated when I am finally able to 'solve' them. 

I would like to take you on a journey through my training to become a developer.

In this repository, you will find my attempts at coding challenges I find. Some might be really simple (because I'm still a noob).

My goal is to improve my coding skils so much so that aside from being able to solve the problems, I would like my code to be efficient (minimize time complexity) and readable (find ways to break down my code/comment them out so it is easily understood)


Thank you,
Sandy
